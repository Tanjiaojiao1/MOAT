## Architecture 

In this work, we propose **MOAT**, a novel one-shot domain adaptation framework for semantic segmentation in remote sensing images. The proposed method alternately maximizes the cross-entropy to select the most informative source samples and minimizes the cross-entropy of obtained samples to make the model fit the target data. The selected source samples can effectively describe the target data distribution using the proposed uncertainty-based distribution estimation technique. Extensive experiments have demonstrate that the prpoposed MOAT boosts the performance of one-shot domain adaptation tasks.
